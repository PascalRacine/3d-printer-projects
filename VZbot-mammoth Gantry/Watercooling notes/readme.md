Watercooling notes here.

When doing a watercooling loop, need to be cautious of the corrosion that can occur when 2 different metals are in the same system called the galvanic reaction

here is a chart for when 2 dissimilar metals are touching each other:

Here is the galvanic corrosion chart when 2 dissimilar metals are in a water system:
this chart is based on seawater

Note: every water system have its own corrosion index chart.

Currently using a mix of Aluminium radiator, Brass that's nickel plated, Aluminium round M6 standoff and aluminium extruder.
Having an issue sourcing all aluminium parts, will inquire on Mellow Hextrudort made our of brass.

Mellow ships brass/nickel plated fitting with the hextrudort.
The common argument of Keep your WC loop all aluminium falls short.

requested mellow a brass hextrudort, will see if it's possible.
Brass does have a lower thermal conductivity then aluminium but will cause less problems down the line with corrosion in the water loop.

eventually i want to increase the diameter of the water line between the pump and the radiator, include manifolds...
Manifolds i saw from Alphacool are nickel coated brass.
Also, i can source M6 hex brass standoff, which will still enable a pass thru.
But i would need to switch to a copper radiator, which are available from Alphacool without much issues.
