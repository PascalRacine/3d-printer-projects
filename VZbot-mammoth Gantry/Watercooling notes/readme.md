Here is the galvanic corrosion chart when 2 dissimilar metals are in a water system:
this chart is based on seawater

Note: every water system have its own corrosion index chart.

Currently using a mix of Aluminium radiator, Brass that's nickel plated, Aluminium round M6 standoff and aluminium extruder.
Having an issue sourcing all aluminium parts, will inquire on Mellow Hextrudort made our of brass.
