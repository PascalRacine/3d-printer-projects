Worked on the project by Mike:

https://www.printables.com/model/1246702-30kg-pulling-power-voron-m4-extruder-kraken-motor

this is what i ended up making: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4e67f51-9645-48a1-a455-7dbdffba0855)

the idea is that the tensionner will provide a tension on the belt of the M404 instead of twisting the motor to get the tension.

Ive added a wheel to manually load the filament

requires:
-1X90mm D5 shaft (i use m5 extractors rods)
-equal or longer then 34mm Shaft Nema 17, the D55 from stepperonline works or the Kraken 5mm shafts.
-will need to deflange a 20tooth pulley for the handle.
- i will be using a 8mmX8mm steel bar stock to push the pulley assembly inside.


  MTF on the electronic combination that i with to do.
