a word about stepper motors...
as per recent conversation, the different classes of insulation enables the use of stepper motors a higher RUNNING temperature.
Not ambient temperature.
Class H insulation enables steppers to run at 165 degree celcius shaft internal temperature (typically websites advertise 180 degree celcius operation)
But they are all rated at 40 degree Celcius ambient temperature.
