Notes about the supervolcano
Little of a crazy project, 
wanted to run a supervolcano block on the toolhead.

Been told that i could just get a goliath but i figured it would be different.
Tried initially to get the mount made out of stainless steel but had issues with heat creep.

On the negative sides, the part is so bulky in the back that it's eating through the SLS nylon printed duct.
Also, it heatcreeps after 280Celcius, added titanium washers and changed the screws for titanium without any success.

Tested an intermediate by opening it up with my .5 inch belted sander

finalized the design:

Made a titanium body from PCBway

looks good, no more heatcreep at 320Celcius for Polymaker tough PC, which is a good thing.

I imagine that it would just be possible to stack titanium washers to a degree that the stainless mount would be feasible, but i do not know how to calculate that.
in the mean time, i figured that a way to make this affordeable would be to have a composite mount that would be part SS, part titanium.
If the part would be lasercut out of titanium, it would reduce the cost significantly.
